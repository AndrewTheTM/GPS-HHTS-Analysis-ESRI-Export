# GPS Data ESRI Export 

## Background 

In my other project at https://github.com/okiandrew/GPS-HHTS-Analysis, I am building a tool to reprocess GPS data from 
a GPS-Based Household Survey. This is a companion tool that reads the data into an ESRI Geodatabase. 

## Programming Work - Current 

Currently, this reads in data to points.

## Programming Work - Envisioned 

The following are tasks that need to be included:

1. Reading data into lines

## Requirements 

ArcMap.
